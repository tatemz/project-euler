# Project Euler

**WARNING: This repo contains solution sets for computational/mathematical problems. If you'd rather solve them yourself, then go do just that and come back to compare your solutions to mine.**

I aspire to be a better programmer. I recently found [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and decided that I would go through 3 problems a week. This repo simply contains my solutions.

These are written in python for now, but I might mix it up and try some other languages at times.

* [Problem 001](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) - [Solution](1-50/001.py)
* [Problem 002](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) - [Solution](1-50/002.py)
